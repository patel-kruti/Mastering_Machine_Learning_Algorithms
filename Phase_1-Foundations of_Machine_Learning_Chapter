Phase 1: Foundations of Machine Learning

✅ Understanding the Basics

What is Machine Learning? – Definition, types (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning)
Mathematical Foundations – Linear algebra, probability, statistics, and calculus basics for ML
Key ML Concepts – Features, labels, training vs. testing, overfitting, underfitting
📌 Hands-on: Implement a basic linear regression model from scratch using NumPy.

📌 What is Machine Learning?
1️⃣ Definition of Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed.

Example:

A spam filter learns to classify emails as spam or not spam based on previous emails.
A stock market model predicts whether a stock price will go up or down based on past trends.

2️⃣ Types of Machine Learning
There are three main types:

Type	                        Description	                                                                                Example
Supervised Learning	            The model learns from labeled data (input → output pairs).	                                Email spam detection (spam or not spam)
Unsupervised Learning	        The model finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data.	                                        Customer segmentation in marketing
Reinforcement Learning	        The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.	    Self-driving cars

🔹 Supervised Learning – We have labeled data (e.g., "This email is spam, this one is not").
🔹 Unsupervised Learning – No labels, the model finds structure in data (e.g., grouping similar customers).
🔹 Reinforcement Learning – The model learns by trial and error (e.g., an AI playing chess).

3️⃣ Key Concepts in ML
Before we jump into algorithms, we need to understand:

✅ Features & Labels

Feature: Input variable (e.g., customer age, salary).
Label: Output variable (e.g., whether a customer buys a product or not).

✅ Training vs. Testing Data

Training Data: The dataset used to train the ML model.
Testing Data: The dataset used to evaluate the ML model.

✅ Overfitting vs. Underfitting

Overfitting: Model learns the training data too well, failing to generalize to new data.
Underfitting: Model is too simple and fails to capture patterns.

📌 Real-world Example
Imagine teaching a kid to recognize cats and dogs:

If the kid memorizes all pictures, they might fail when they see a new dog breed (Overfitting).
If the kid only looks at general shapes, they might mistake a fox for a dog (Underfitting).

🛠 Hands-on Exercise: Implement a Simple ML Model
Let’s implement a simple Linear Regression model in Python using sklearn. This model predicts house prices based on area.
